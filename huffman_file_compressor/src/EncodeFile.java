//    Encoding File
//    Once the Huffman codes have been created, and the Huffman tree (and Magic Number) have been written to the output file, we only need to go through the input file again, character by character, writing out the appropriate code for each character.  Don't forget to close the output file when you are done!
//    File Decompression
//    First, we need to make sure that the magic number matches. If it does, we can go head and do the decompression. If not, then we will print out a message to standard out and exit.
//    Reading Huffman Tree
//    To read in the Huffman tree, we do a preorder traversal of the tree -- guided by the input file -- creating nodes as we go.
